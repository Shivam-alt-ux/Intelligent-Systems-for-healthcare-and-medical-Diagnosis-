![Banner](./public/banner.png)

- Our sign language recognition project involved creating a custom dataset, preprocessing images, training a model, integrating with React, and hosting with Firebase. 

- The result is a real-time sign language recognition application that recognizes a variety of sign language gestures.

- Our Model is trained for 26 alphabets and 16 words of ASL and which are commonly used in general communication.
